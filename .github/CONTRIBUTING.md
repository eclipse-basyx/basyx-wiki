# How to contribute to BaSyx

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in BaSyx**, and instead refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-wiki/security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-wiki/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-wiki/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant information as possible.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write new documentation?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the changes.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what was changed. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of BaSyx will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use BaSyx in the [BaSyx Dev mailing list](mailto:basyx-dev@eclipse.org).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
