# Triggers

The Databridge supports various trigger types that can be used to initiate data synchronization or other actions based on specific conditions. These triggers can be configured to respond to changes in data, time intervals, or external events.

## Trigger Types

* [Event Trigger](./event.md)
* [Timer](./timer.md)
* [Request Trigger](./request.md)
