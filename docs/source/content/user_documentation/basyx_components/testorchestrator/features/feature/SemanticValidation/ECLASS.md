## Semantic Validation with ECLASS

The semantics of the submodel can be validated using ECLASS definition. To achieve this, the key is needed using which the ECLASS Webservice can be accessed. This is an optional feature. Thus, if the key is absent, the semantic validation will not be conducted. 

If you want to validate the semantics of the Property Submodel Elements added in the submodels, then you can use this service. You need to keep the `.pfx` file in the folder `keys`.
