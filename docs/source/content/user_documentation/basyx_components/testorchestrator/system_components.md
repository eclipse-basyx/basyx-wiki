# ðŸ§© System Components of the Test Orchestrator
This section provides an overview of the main components involved in the Test Orchestrator architecture and how they interact to validate AAS Submodels.

## High-Level Architecture

The diagram below outlines the integration between the BaSyx Submodel Repository, AAS Web UI, MQTT Broker, and the Test Orchestrator components.

## ðŸ”§ Component Breakdown

### 1. AAS/Submodel Repository
Stores the uploaded submodels and triggers events on creation/update/deletion.

### 2. MQTT Broker
Handles event-driven messaging and allows the orchestrator to respond to submodel lifecycle events.

### 3. Deserializer
Parses incoming JSON or AASX files into structured AAS model objects.

### 4. Data Validator
Coordinates the comparison logic using schema matching and validation rules.

### 5. Result Submodels
All resultsâ€”errors, warnings, etc.â€”are written back to dedicated TestResult submodels.

## Core Modules

- **Deserializer**  
  Parses JSON input and schema files into AAS model objects. Ensures version compatibility (AASX v3).

- **Comparator**  
  Selects the right schema via `SemanticId` and coordinates the validation process.

- **RecursionFunc**  
  Implements recursive validation of nested SubmodelElementCollections.

- **SMEComparator**  
  Applies multiplicity rules (`One`, `ZeroToOne`, `OneToMany`, `ZeroToMany`) and qualifier checks.

- **ComparisonResult**  
  Collects errors, warnings, differences, and info messages into a standardized format.

- **ResultSubmodelFactory**  
  Creates new result Submodels for reporting, including unsupported version or missing `SemanticId` cases.
