The AAS Registry is a server that provides a REST API to register and search for Asset Administration Shells based on their shell descriptors.

The server is based on the [Open-API specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Plattform_i40/AssetAdministrationShellRegistryServiceSpecification/V3.0_SSP-001) of the [German Plattform Industrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/) and the [IDTA](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/) in the specification document [Details of the Asset Administration Shell, Part 2](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01002-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part2_API.pdf).

## Features

[basyx.aasregistry-client-native](features/client-native.md) can be used to interact with the backend to register or unregister descriptors and submodels or perform search operations.

[basyx.aasregistry-paths](features/paths.md) generates a builder class that can be used by the registry client to create search requests.

[basyx.aasregistry-plugins](features/plugins.md) contains maven plugins used by the other projects. 

[basyx.aasregistry-service](features/service.md) provides the application server to access the AAS descriptor storage and offers an API for REST-based communication.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-basemodel](features/service-basemodel.md) provides a base model implementation that should be used if you do not need specific model annotations for your storage. It is used for the in-memory storage implementation and you need to add it explicitly as dependency for your server deployment as it is defined as 'provided' dependency in the [basyx.aasregistry-service](basyx.aasregistry-service/README.md) POM.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-basetests](features/service-basetest.md) provides helper classes and abstract test classes that can be extended in storage tests or integration tests. The abstract test classes already define test methods so that you will get a good test coverage without writing any additional test cases.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-mongodb-storage](features/mongodb-storage.md) provides a registry-storage implementation based on mongoDB that could be used as storage for [aasregistry-service](basyx.aasregistry-service/README.md). It comes with java-based model classes, annotated with mongoDB annotations.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-inmemory-storage](features/inmemory-storage.md) provides a non-persistent registry-storage implementation where instances are stored in hash maps. It can be used as storage for [aasregistry-service](basyx.aasregistry-service/README.md).

[basyx.aasregistry-service-kafka-events](features/kafka-events.md) extends basyx.aasregistry-service with a registry-event-sink implementation that delivers shell descriptor and submodel registration events using Apache Kafka. The default provided by aasregistry-service just logs the events.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-release-kafka-mongodb](features/kafka-mongodb.md) is used to combine the server artifacts to a release image that uses [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as event sink and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as storage.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-release-kafka-mem](features/kafka-mem.md) is used to combine the server artifacts to a release image that uses Apache Kafka as event sink and an in-memory storage.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-release-log-mongodb](features/log-mongodb.md) is used to combine the server artifacts to a release image that logs registry events and uses MongoDB as data storage.

[basyx.aasregistry-service-release-log-mem](features/log-mem.md) is used to combine the server artifacts to a release image that logs registry events and an in-memory storage.

A docker-compose file that illustrates the setup can be found in the [docker-compose](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) folder.

## Server Configuration

### Backend Configuration
There is no separate configuration for a backend. To use a specific backend, you must use the appropriate storage implementation.

However, if you are using a MongoDB module, you will need to set the connection uri for the MongoDB storage implementation:
```properties
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://mongoAdmin:mongoPassword@mongo:27017
```
---

### CORS Configuration
Configure CORS settings to specify allowed origins and methods.

```properties
basyx:
  cors:
    allowed-origins: '*'
    allowed-methods: GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE,PUT,OPTIONS,HEAD
```

### 
```{note}
A favicon is a small 16×16 or 32×32 pixel icon, symbol or logo used by web browsers to identify a website in a recognizable way
```
To configure the favicon, mount your favicon to the `static` directory of the component using Docker:
```
docker run --name=aas-registry -p:8081:8081 -v C:/path/to/favicon.ico:/application/static/favicon.ico eclipsebasyx/aas-registry-log-mem:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```
or
```yaml
aas-registry:
    image: eclipsebasyx/aas-registry-log-mem:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    container_name: aas-registry
    volumes:
      - ./basyx/aas-registry.properties:/application/application.properties
	  - ./basyx/static/favicon.ico:/application/static/favicon.ico
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
```

## Docker
The following example demonstrates how to use the AAS Registry with Docker Compose:

```yml
aas-registry:
    image: eclipsebasyx/aas-registry-log-mongodb:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    container_name: aas-registry
    ports:
      - '8083:8080'
    environment:
      - SERVER_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - ./basyx/aas-registry.yml:/workspace/config/application.yml
    restart: always
```

## Virtual Machine
Eclipse BaSyx provides the AAS Registry as a virtual machine image for Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player. At the moment, only the version that logs registry events and uses an in-memory storage is available as a virtual machine image. So, it is not possible to use Apache Kafka as event sink or MongoDB as storage.

The image can be found [here](https://oc.iese.de/index.php/s/9JyJAuOlhh9vMUu). How to use it is described [here](../../../user_tutorials/virtualmachines/alpine_virtualmachine_setup_use.md).


## Build Resources

To build the images run these commands from this folder or for the parent project pom:

Install maven generate jars:

``` shell 
mvn clean install
```

In order to build the docker images, you need to specify *docker.namespace* and *docker.password* properties (here without running tests):

``` shell
MAVEN_OPS='-Xmx2048 -Xms1024' mvn clean install -DskipTests -Ddocker.namespace=eclipsebasyx -Ddocker.password=""
```

You can now check your images from command-line and push the images:
``` shell 
docker images   ...
```
Or you can directly push them from maven. 

``` shell 
MAVEN_OPS='-Xmx2048 -Xms1024' mvn deploy -Ddocker.registry=docker.io -Ddocker.namespace=eclipsebasyx -Ddocker.password=pwd
```
In addition, maven deploy will also deploy your maven artifacts, so you can do everything in one step.

Have a look at the *docker-compose* sub-folder to see how the created images could be referenced in docker-compose files.

Consider updating the [image name pattern](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk/blob/main/basyx.aasregistry/pom.xml#L16) if you want a different image name.

## Swagger UI
In the Swagger UI, you can find the API documentation for the AAS Registry.

You can also execute all the API calls directly from the Swagger UI.
