# Authorization
This feature enables authorized access to the AssetAdministrationShell Repository.

```{note}
Only Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is supported as authorization type as of now, also Keycloak is the only Jwt token provider supported now and it is also a default provider. 
```

To learn more about RBAC, please refer to the [Authorization Services Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html).

To learn more about the Keycloak server administration, please refer [Server Administration Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#keycloak-features-and-concepts)

An example valid configuration:

```
basyx.feature.authorization.enabled = true
basyx.feature.authorization.type = rbac
basyx.feature.authorization.jwtBearerTokenProvider = keycloak
basyx.feature.authorization.rbac.file = classpath:rbac_rules.json
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri= http://localhost:9096/realms/BaSyx
```

## RBAC rule configuration

To configure the RBAC rules, you need to create a JSON file for them. Rules could like shown below:

```
[
  {
    "role": "basyx-reader",
    "action": "READ",
    "targetInformation": {
      "@type": "aas",
      "aasIds": "*"
    }
  },
  {
    "role": "admin",
    "action": ["CREATE", "READ", "UPDATE", "DELETE"],
    "targetInformation": {
      "@type": "aas",
      "aasIds": "*"
    }
  },
  {
    "role": "basyx-deleter",
    "action": "DELETE",
    "targetInformation": {
      "@type": "aas",
      "aasIds": ["testAasId1", "specificAasId", "testAasId2"]
    }
  }
 ]
```

A `role` specifies which actions are permitted to be performed by said users of that role. Roles are determined according to the configuration of identity providers or organizational settings. Possible actions include `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `EXECUTE`. These actions may be configured as either a single action or a list of multiple actions (see admin configuration above).

The targetInformation defines coarse-grained control over the resource, you may define the aasIds with a wildcard (\*), it means the defined role x with action y can access any Asset Administration Shell on the repository.

You can also define a specific AAS Identifier in place of the wildcard (\*), then the role x with action y could be performed only on that particular AAS. There could be a single aasId or multiple aasIds as a list (cf. basyx-deleter above). 

```{note}
- The Actions are static as of now and limited to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `EXECUTE`
    - (Later, a user-configurable mapping of these actions will be provided)
- Each rule should be unique in combination of role + action + target information
```

## Action table for RBAC

Below is a reference table that shows which actions are used in what endpoints of the AAS Repository: 

| Action  | Endpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
