>As AAS Components user
>I want to interact with the AAS Environment Component through a graphical user interface

The AAS Web UI can act as a user interface to the AAS Environment. It is possible to use the features of the AAS Environment through the AAS Web UI.

## Feature Overview

Through the AAS Environment Integration it is possible to upload Asset Administration Shell Files (AASX) to the AAS Environment. A complete feature overview for the AAS Environment Component can be found [here](../../v2/aas_environment/index.md#features).

Furthermore, the AAS Environment will automatically register uploaded AASs and Submodels.

## Feature Configuration

The AAS Environment Integration can be configured in the main menu of the AAS Web UI. The configuration is done by entering the URLs of the repository components.

```{hint}
Keep in mind that the AAS Environment Component must be running in order to use this feature.

The AAS Environment is an aggregation of the 3 repositories (AAS Repository, Submodel Repository, and Concept Description Repository).
```
