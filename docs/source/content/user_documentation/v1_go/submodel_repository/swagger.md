# Swagger UI
All BaSyx Components, including the Submodel Repository, serve a static Swagger UI that is accessible via the server base path (e.g. http://localhost:5004 or http://localhost:5004/your-context-path), or directly via the /swagger endpoint (e.g. http://localhost:5004/swagger or http://localhost:5004/your-context-path/swagger)

## What is a Swagger UI?
The Swagger UI lists all available Endpoints. It also allows you to send requests to the server.

## How do I configure it?
There is no additional configuration needed, BaSyx automatically serves the Swagger UI to you!
