# Documented Application Scenarios

In the following, multiple example application scenarios are presented that illustrate basic concepts on how to use the Eclipse BaSyx middleware. Each scenario is implemented in the *basyx.example* project.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

* ADS_connector
* authorization
* cloud-edge-deployment
* device-integration
* monitoring_scenarios
* static_dynamic_extension

```


This list will be continuously extended.

* [Device Integration](device-integration.md): Showcases how to utilize the various features of the BaSyx OTS components to bidirectionally integrate a device with its Asset Administration Shell
* [Cloud & Edge Deployment](cloud-edge-deployment.md): Showcases how to set up a distributed deployment of an AAS with several Submodels.
* [Dynamic Extension of Static Data](static_dynamic_extension.md): Showcases how to load static AAS/Submodels (e.g. from an AASX file) and modify them at runtime (e.g. by adding a programmed submodel).
* [Authorized AAS Registry](authorization.md): Showcases how to set up Keycloak server and secure the endpoint of AAS Registry. It showcases the same scenario of [Cloud & Edge Deployment](cloud-edge-deployment.md) with Authorized AAS Registry.

Moreover, there are three predefined scenarios that showcase examples about how a monitoring scenario with 3rd-party applications can be realized. There is a user-centric introduction on how to start them in the wiki: [user documentation](../../../../integrated%20end-user%20applications/monitoring_scenarios.md). Moreover, you can find more information about the background and the utilized architecture in these scenarios in the [developer documentation](monitoring_scenarios.md).

## Extension Scenarios
In the following, further examples are described. These examples showcase the extension possibilities of BaSyx.

* [ADS Connector](ADS_connector.md): Showcases how the VAB can be extended to support the ADS protocol.
